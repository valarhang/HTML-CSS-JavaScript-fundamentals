            <h3>The beginning</h3>
            <p><strong> 9 October is National Polenta Day</strong> , the traditional  peasant food made with a cornmeal and water mixture. One of the main ingredients for tasty local dishes, polenta is suitable for various recipes and combines perfectly with other products.
            </p>
            <p>
            Mixing coarsely ground cereals with hot water dates back to prehistoric times. Instead, the origins of polenta can be traced back to Roman times, when people used to eat a similar mash of ground spelt and water served with cheese or meat. However, authentic polenta appears at the beginning of the 16th century, after the overseas travels to the New World. Explorers imported native products from the new lands the Old World had never seen before, including corn. The precious golden-coloured cereal began to be planted and consumed throughout Europe.
            </p>
            <h3>Polenta then</h3>
            <p>
            Corn began to spread in the <strong>early 1500s</strong> as cattle feed. Later, it spread as one of the main ingredients of the poor peasant diet in the Northern regions. People grounded and cooked corn with water; then they served polenta accompanied by legumes or cheese. Peasants had already cooked and eaten a similar dish before, but it was based on spelt, rye or other cereal flour. However, the introduction of corn in our crops led to the common use of cornmeal, from which one of the most appreciated dishes of national cuisine was born.            
            </p>
            <h3>Polenta now</h3>
            <p>
            As we have seen,<strong> polenta is not a gourmet dish</strong>  but rather a recipe linked to the frugal life of the past. However, its consumption has become so deeply rooted in the culinary traditions of the world that it is now one of the typical national dishes. Given its neutral taste, it is easy to combine with other products (cheese, meat, fish, vegetables, mushrooms, etc.), making it the perfect side dish or primary ingredient for many dishes with a unique flavour. Traditional recipes and local reinterpretations rule in every gastronomy. Still, food means more than just feeding for humans. Like so many other traditional dishes, polenta represents an instrument of communication to transmit the values of <strike>cooked meal</strike>.
